# DSA LABORATORY 3
1. Lab Exercise 1: Squaring Odd Integers
This program takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where only the odd numbers are squared. It’s smart enough to leave the even numbers alone and focuses on just the odd ones! All of this is done using a cool Python trick called list comprehension.
2. Lab Exercise 2: Pairing Up Two Lists
Here, we take two lists—one of numbers and one of names—and pair them together into tuples. It’s like matching people with their favorite numbers! Once again, we use list comprehension to make it all happen quickly and cleanly.
3. Lab Exercise 3: Vowels to Uppercase
This one’s all about string manipulation. The goal is to take a sentence or word and turn all the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) into uppercase letters. We’re using another clever Python technique—list comprehension—to scan through each letter and make those vowels stand out.
